I have tried to create the simplest model possible for a quick training. The Jupyter notebook and the HTML file hold the report with a loss around 3.5 as per project requirements. I used lecture notes and videos on Udacity DL program. A similar project with creating new text out of Anna Karenina novel had detailed explanations. This project with TV-script generation was a simplified version of previous lecture videos on Udacity. For example, the less commonly used words were not removed from the input features. I also checked PyTorch and Stackoverflow on a few bugs and also consulted github profiles of various implementations on Keras.
